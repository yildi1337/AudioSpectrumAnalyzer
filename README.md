The directory *processing* contains an audio spectrum analyzer test program written in [Processing](https://processing.org/) and runnable on a PC. I used this program for testing purposes prior to programming the Raspberry Pi in C (directory *firmware*).

The contents of the other directories should be self-explanatory. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!
